# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
For Project_Three.cpp, I created an Item-Tracking program for a Corner Grocery store. The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records of the grocery items purchased
throughout the day. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their 
consumers. My program allows the user to search for a grocery item by typing in the item's name and the output is a numeric value for the frequency of the searched grocery item. This program also allows the user to print a list with numbers that represent the frequency of each and all items purchased. In addition, this program can print that list with the same frequency information but in the form of a histogram. This is why the program can effectively let the Corner Grocery store know how often items are purchased.
