# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
For Project_Three.cpp, I created an Item-Tracking program for a Corner Grocery store. The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records of the grocery items purchased
throughout the day. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their 
consumers. My program allows the user to search for a grocery item by typing in the item's name and the output is a numeric value for the frequency of the searched grocery item. This program also allows the user to print a list with numbers that represent the frequency of each and all items purchased. In addition, this program can print that list with the same frequency information but in the form of a histogram. This is why the program can effectively let the Corner Grocery store know how often items are purchased.          

# What did you do particularly well? 
I made the menu display particulary well. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc? 
I could enhance this code by finding a way to make the program print the expected output for one case at a time from the switch statement without the use of a break statement at the end of each case. These improvements would make my code more efficient because the quantity of a grocery item would be more accurate in the output.    

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your wupport network? 
One challenging piece was writing the loops that iterated over tempList to count the occurances of a grocery item. To help me with this project, I searched Google for C++ methods that I could possibly use. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? 
Running the program while I write it to make the debugging process simpler later is particulary transferable to other course work.
