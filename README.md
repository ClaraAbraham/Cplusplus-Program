# Cplusplus-Program 

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
I created a program that allows users to be able to view a 12-hour and 24-hour clock simultaneously. The user can also set and reset the time that is displayed on the clocks.    

# What did you do particularly well? 
I called method functions and utilized them well in the main function of the program. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc? 
I could enhance this code by ensuring that when a user adds an hour to the time, that the time increments by 1 number exactly and not jumps up by 2 numbers. This improvement will make the code more efficient because the user wouldn't have to keep on pressing the button to change the hour until it goes back to zero and then goes to the desired number.
