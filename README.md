# Cplusplus-Program 

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
For the project, I created an object-oriented programming application for a website that has domestic and international clients. This app allows users to be able to view a 12-hour and 24-hour clock simultaneously. The user can also set and reset the time that is displayed on the clocks. The problem it was solving was that in order for it has to meet international standard ISO 8601.     

# What did you do particularly well? 
I called method functions and utilized them well in the main function of the program. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc? 
I could enhance this code by ensuring that when a user adds an hour to the time, that the time increments by 1 number exactly and not jumps up by 2 numbers. This improvement will make the code more efficient because the user wouldn't have to keep on pressing the button to change the hour until it goes back to zero and then goes to the desired number.  

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? 
One challenging piece was the method function named, printMenu, because I had to create a loop that will print asterisks, whitespaces, and menu options. To help me with this project, I used Tutor.com to get online help from a tutor.  

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
I think I will  ..

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I used in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions, which is industry standard best practices, to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
